# Signal Booster - Refactored Solution

## 📋 Project Summary

This project represents a comprehensive refactoring of a legacy DME (Durable Medical Equipment) data extraction utility. The original code was a monolithic, poorly-structured console application that extracted medical equipment information from physician notes and transmitted it to an external API. 

This refactored solution transforms the legacy codebase into a maintainable, testable, and production-ready application following modern software engineering best practices.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Core Objectives

1. **Code Structure & Readability**
   - ✅ Refactor monolithic `Main` method into well-named, single-responsibility methods
   - ✅ Replace cryptic variable names with clear, descriptive identifiers
   - ✅ Implement proper separation of concerns
   - ✅ Remove redundant and dead code
   - ✅ Use consistent naming conventions throughout

2. **Error Handling & Observability**
   - ✅ Implement comprehensive logging for operational visibility
   - ✅ Add robust error handling without swallowing exceptions
   - ✅ Provide meaningful error messages and recovery mechanisms
   - ✅ Enable monitoring and debugging capabilities

3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - ✅ Create comprehensive unit test coverage
   - ✅ Implement testable architecture with dependency injection
   - ✅ Ensure code is verifiable and maintainable
   - ✅ Add integration tests where appropriate

4. **Documentation & Maintainability**
   - ✅ Replace misleading comments with clear, helpful documentation
   - ✅ Provide inline code documentation
   - ✅ Create comprehensive README with usage instructions
   - ✅ Document architectural decisions and assumptions

5. **Functional Requirements**
   - ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
   - ✅ Read physician notes from files
   - ✅ Extract structured DME data (device types, providers, qualifiers)
   - ✅ Submit data to external API endpoint
   - ✅ Support CPAP, oxygen tank, and wheelchair equipment types

### Optional Stretch Goals

6. **Advanced Features**
   - 🔄 Integration with LLM services (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI) for enhanced extraction
   - 🔄 Support for multiple input formats (JSON, XML, structured text)
   - 🔄 Configurable file paths and API endpoints
   - 🔄 Extended DME device type support
   - 🔄 Real-time processing capabilities
